This is a small sample of an obstacle rage game I made by studying and applying all the knowledge i got from a Udemy Course by Kaan Alpar, all rights reserved. All assets were free from the FAB store.
Assets were: @Survival Character FREE, @Construction Site VOL. 1 - Supply and Material Props, @Stylized Eastern Village. The level design of props was made by me and it's a small sample. Showcase of
C++ knowledge and blueprint knowledge and also expert handling of UE5 UI, for CV and job application purposes.
